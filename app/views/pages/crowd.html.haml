          %p Real democracy is about collaboration: groups of people getting together and making decisions that work for everyone.

          %p Loomio fills a critical gap. Social media has made it so easy to communicate that one person can reach thousands in a matter of hours. But a decision is what turns talk into action, and there's no easy way to make decisions together online.

          %p
            We've taken all the learning from thousands of groups using our beta prototype and
            %strong designed a whole new mobile platform
            for truly inclusive decision-making: Loomio 1.0

            It needs to be
            %strong mobile,
            to include people in places where computers and internet are scarce.
          %p
            So we’re building a platform that works on any device, built with best in open mobile technology: Ruby on Rails, AngularJS, HTML5
          .divider
          %h3
            It needs to be

            to include all kinds of people.
          %p
            So we’ve designed it to be as easy to use as email, so you don’t need to be a computer geek to participate.

          %p
            So we’re making it really easy to set up and run your own independent version, so your privacy is entirely under your own control.
