          %h3 Real democracy is about collaboration: groups of people getting together and making decisions that work for everyone.

          %p Loomio fills a critical gap: bringing online talk to real world action. Social media and email have made it so easy to communicate, but a decision is what turns talk into action. Right now, there's no easy way to make decisions together online. It's like a missing piece of the internet.

          %p
            We've taken all the learning from thousands of groups using our beta prototype and designed a whole new platform for truly inclusive decision-making: Loomio 1.0
